### ðŸ––About & history
Motivated by the passion to discover new perspectives, cultures and travelling, I started my academic and profissional life in Turism. I worked on many segments but I became specialized at Customer Experience, Risk and Crisis Management and Leadership. Recently, I rediscovered myself on the IT area, started to study it by myself and decided to change my paths by entering a degree in informatics engineering.
